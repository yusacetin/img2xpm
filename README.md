### Image to XPM Converter
Converts various image formats to XPM losslessly. Not the best way to do it but gets the job done. Works on any image size but execution time skyrockets really quickly.

#### How to use
`python img2xpm.py [INPUT FILEPATH] [OUTPUT FILEPATH]`

If [OUTPUT FILEPATH] is provided it's used as the output file name, otherwise the output is named [input filename].xpm
